          Born from a passion for creativity and an insatiable curiosity for
          design, Shola embarked on her journey through the corridors of
          knowledge at the University of Ilorin, where she pursued her studies
          in Library and Information Science. As she nears the culmination of
          her academic pursuits, her educational foundation serves as a
          springboard for her foray into the world of fashion, instilling in her
          a dedication to precision and an appreciation for the intricate
          balance of form and function.
